# Build Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for managing the Novel Studio build process.

## clean-build

Cleans all build artifacts and caches to fix build issues, especially path reference problems.

### Usage

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\clean-build.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/clean-build.sh
./scripts/clean-build.sh
```

### What it cleans

- `src-tauri/target/` - Rust/Cargo build cache
- `dist/` - Vite build output
- `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` - TypeScript build info
- (Optional) `node_modules/` - Node dependencies (commented out by default)

### When to use

Run this script when you encounter:
- Build errors referencing old paths (e.g., `Novel-IDE` instead of `Novel-Studio`)
- Cached build artifacts causing issues
- After renaming the project
- After major dependency updates
- When build output seems stale or corrupted

### After cleaning

Run one of these commands to rebuild:
```bash
npm run tauri:dev    # Development mode
npm run tauri:build  # Production build
```

## Troubleshooting

If the script doesn't fix your build issue:

1. **Clean node_modules**: Uncomment the node_modules section in the script
2. **Check Cargo cache**: Run `cargo clean` manually in `src-tauri/`
3. **Clear global Cargo cache**: `cargo cache -a` (requires cargo-cache tool)
4. **Restart your terminal**: Sometimes environment variables need refreshing
5. **Check disk space**: Ensure you have enough space for the build

## Notes

- The script is safe to run multiple times
- It only removes generated files, not source code
- Your `node_modules` are preserved by default (faster rebuilds)
- If you need a complete clean install, uncomment the node_modules section
